### Abstract:
  1. For semantic urban scene understanding, they introduce Cityscapes, a dataset to train and test approaches for __pixel-level__ and __instance-level__ semantic labeling.
  2. stereo video sequences recorded in streets from 50 different cities:
      1. 5000 high quality pixel-level annotations
      2. 20000 coarse annotations -  to enable methods that leverage large volumes of __weakly-labeled data__
  3. their _accompanying(附带的)_ _empirical study(实证研究)_ provides an _in-depth analysis(深入分析)_ of the dataset characteristics: performance evaluation of several state-of-the-art approaches based on Citysacpes Dataset.
