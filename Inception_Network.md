### Inception v1 -----> GoogleNet
   1. Naive version  ![](image/Inception_v1.png)
   2. Inception module with dimension reductions  ![](image/Inception_v1_1.png)
   3. GoogleNet, has 9 such inception modules stacked linearly, It is 22 layers deep (27, including the pooling layers). It uses **global average pooling** at the end of the last inception module.

      1. Auxiliary loss 
         1. To prevent the middle part from 'dying out', so the authors introduced two _auxiliary classifiers_ã€€
         2. Loss function  
            total_loss = real_loss + 0.3 * aux_loss_1 + 0.3 * aux_loss_2
         3. Auxiliary loss is purely used for training purposes, and is ignored during inference.
